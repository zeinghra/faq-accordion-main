## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- VSCode Editor


### Continued development

I will probably focus more on learning ES6 javascript.


### Useful resources

- [blackbox ai](https://www.blackbox.ai) - This helped me for creating the accordion with the latest standards.
- [W3Schools](w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp) - This helped to understand the code I brought from blackbox ai. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
